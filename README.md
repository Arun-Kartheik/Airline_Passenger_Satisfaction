# Airline_Passenger_Satisfaction
    
In this project, I have to work on airline passenger satisfaction dataset, where there are 1,29,980 rows and 24 columns.
It has 19 columns consisting of numerical and 5 categorical columns. Target column is categorical, so I performed 
classification machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes,
SVM, ADABOOST, XGBOOST are applied. After performing class imbalance and feature selection I concluded that for the 
three dataframes XGBOOST is the best fitted model.
